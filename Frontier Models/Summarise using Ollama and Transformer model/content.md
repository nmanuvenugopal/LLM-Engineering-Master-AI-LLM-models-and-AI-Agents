### 🚀 How to Use Frontier Models

Frontier models such as **GPT-4.0**, **GPT-3.5 Turbo**, **Claude**, etc., can be used in multiple ways depending on your use case, infrastructure, and preference. Below are the three most common ways to interact with these models:

---

#### 1. 🧠 Chat Interface (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude.ai)

The most straightforward way to use a frontier model is through an interactive **chat interface**, such as:
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
- [Claude by Anthropic](https://claude.ai/)
- [Gemini (formerly Bard) by Google](https://gemini.google.com/)

These are ideal for **manual testing**, **idea exploration**, or **non-programmatic usage**.

#### 2. ☁️ Cloud APIs & Frameworks (Programmatic Access)

You can programmatically access frontier models using cloud-hosted APIs and frameworks:

- **OpenAI API** (via Python SDK)
- **LangChain** (for building LLM-powered pipelines)
- **LLM orchestration platforms** such as:
  - **Azure OpenAI Service**
  - **AWS Bedrock**
  - **Google Vertex AI**

These options are ideal for **scalable, production-grade LLM applications**.

> ✅ This approach supports structured prompting using the `role: system/user/assistant` format.

#### 3. 💾 Local Deployment using Hugging Face + Ollama

You can also run models locally by downloading them from the **Hugging Face Model Hub** or other sources and loading them with tools like:

- [**Ollama**](https://ollama.com/) – Simplifies local model management and inference.
- **Transformers Library** by Hugging Face

Examples:
```bash
ollama run llama2
ollama run mistral
```

This method is best when you need **offline inference**, **custom tuning**, or **data privacy**.
