### üöÄ Mastering LLM Engineering in 8 Weeks

This repository documents my journey through an 8-week hands-on course on **Large Language Model (LLM) Engineering**, covering cutting-edge techniques in prompt engineering, fine-tuning, RAG pipelines, agentic AI, and more ‚Äî using tools like **OpenAI**, **Claude**, **Hugging Face**, **Gradio**, and **Olama**.

The course was structured around weekly commercial-grade projects and covered both **closed-source frontier models** and **open-source alternatives**, aiming to build production-ready AI solutions.

## üß† Key Learnings

- Working with frontier models (GPT-4, Claude 3.5)
- Prompting via UI and API (ChatGPT, Anthropic)
- Building multimodal AI assistants (voice + image)
- Code generation using LLMs (Python ‚ûù C++)
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline development
- Fine-tuning open-source models to compete with GPT-4
- Agentic AI: Multi-agent collaboration for real-world tasks
- Hugging Face: Pipelines API, tokenizer exploration, model benchmarking

## üìÖ Weekly Breakdown

| Week | Focus Area | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Frontier Models** | Introduction to advanced LLMs via ChatGPT, Claude, and API access. Start building a commercial-grade project. |
| 2 | **Multimodal AI Assistant** | Create a chatbot using **Gradio** that supports images, audio, and tool calling via local execution. |
| 3 | **Open-Source LLMs** | Deep dive into Hugging Face: Pipelines, tokenizers, and API-based model usage. |
| 4 | **Model Selection & Code Generation** | Compare model performance using benchmarks. Build a Python-to-C++ code generator. |
| 5 | **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** | Build a custom RAG pipeline to answer organization-specific queries using vector databases. |
| 6 | **Business Use Case Setup** | Start a 3-week flagship project. Collect data, build traditional ML baselines, and experiment with fine-tuning LLMs. |
| 7 | **Open-Source Fine-Tuning** | Fine-tune open-source models to match GPT-4 level performance on a business task. |
| 8 | **Agentic AI Finale** | Build an autonomous multi-agent system (7 agents) solving a real-world task, including push notification features. |

## üí¨ Reflections

This course provided me with both theoretical grounding and extensive practical exposure. I experimented with local models, benchmarked performance, tackled commercial problems, and built full-stack GenAI apps. The capstone agentic AI project was a highlight!
